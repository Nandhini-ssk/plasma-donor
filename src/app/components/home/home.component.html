        What is plasma in blood?
        Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. About 55% of our blood is plasma, and the remaining 45% are red blood cells,
        white blood cells and platelets that are suspended in the plasma.
    
        Plasma is about 92% water. It also contains 7% vital proteins such as albumin, gamma globulin and anti-hemophilic
        factor, and 1% mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones and vitamins.
    
        Plasma serves four important functions in our body:
    
        1. Helps maintain blood pressure and volume.
    
        2. Supply critical proteins for blood clotting and immunity.
    
        3. Carries electrolytes such as sodium and potassium to our muscles.
    
        4. Helps to maintain a proper pH balance in the body, which supports cell function.
    
        What is blood plasma used for?
        Plasma is commonly given to trauma, burn and shock patients, as well as people with severe liver disease or multiple
        clotting factor deficiencies. It helps boost the patient’s blood volume, which can prevent shock, and helps with
        blood
        clotting. Pharmaceutical companies use plasma to make treatments for conditions such as immune deficiencies and
        bleeding
        disorders.
    
        What is a plasma donation?
        In a plasma-only donation, the liquid portion of the donor’s blood is separated from the cells. Blood is drawn from
        one
        arm and sent through a high-tech machine that collects the plasma. The donor’s red blood cells and platelets are
        then
        returned to the donor along with some saline. The process is safe and only takes a few minutes longer than donating
        whole blood.
    
        Donated plasma is frozen within 24 hours of being donated to preserve its valuable clotting factors. It can be
        stored
        for up to one year and thawed for transfusion to a patient when needed. Red Cross donations are often used directly
        for
        hospital patient transfusions, rather than pharmaceutical uses.
    
        Who should donate plasma?
        The Red Cross urges people with type AB blood to consider a plasma donation. AB is the only universal plasma and can
        be
        given to patients of any blood type. This means that type AB plasma transfusions can be given immediately, without
        losing precious time determining if the patient’s blood type is compatible. In emergency medicine, such as caring
        for a
        major trauma or burn patient, time saved can mean the difference between life and death.
        Type AB plasma donations – which the Red Cross calls “AB Elite” – can be made every 28 days, up to 13 times per
        year.
        The average donation takes one hour and 15 minutes, just a few minutes longer than donating whole blood. Schedule an
        appointment now.
